What is the Matsato Knife AU?

The Matsato Knife AU is a premium chef’s knife inspired by traditional Japanese craftsmanship. Designed for versatility, it’s crafted to handle a wide range of kitchen tasks—from slicing and dicing vegetables to filleting fish and cutting through meats.

What sets the Matsato Knife apart is its fusion of Japanese blade-making heritage with modern materials and ergonomic design. It combines razor-sharp precision with a sturdy handle that ensures comfort and control, even during long prep sessions. Made for both professional chefs and everyday home cooks, it's marketed as a reliable all-rounder that can replace several other knives in the kitchen.
How Does the Matsato Knife Work?

The Matsato Knife operates with the efficiency and balance of traditional Japanese knives like the Santoku or Gyuto. Its high-carbon stainless steel blade is engineered for optimal sharpness and durability, allowing you to slice through various ingredients effortlessly.

The knife’s slightly curved edge makes it ideal for rocking motions when chopping herbs or vegetables, while the tapered point is perfect for precision work, such as de-boning or peeling.

Key components that contribute to its performance include:

    Double-beveled edge: Makes it suitable for both right and left-handed users.

    Full tang construction: The blade runs through the handle, adding balance and strength.

    Ergonomic handle: Typically made from Packwood or a similar durable material for a comfortable grip.
